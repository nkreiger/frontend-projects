This example page is a project completed in the Devslopes program.

It is a basic front-end project that shows core abilities that I learned utilizing CSS, and building my own framework versus applying an already created one like Twitter Bootstrap.

It is mobile friendly, and responsive to screen changes.

Lastly, see other projects for better examples of my skills in web development.

Thanks,
Noah Kreiger
