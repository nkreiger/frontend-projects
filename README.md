Welcome to Noah Kreiger's GitHub Page!!!

I hope you enjoy looking at my projects, and that we can work together in the future.

Notes:
	The web-resume-code code is a comprehensive page that includes all my skills, experiences, education, and links to the separate pages that host my individual projects. This is a great place to start, and then go from their to choose individual projects that may interest you.



For any questions or inquiries please reach out to me by email:
noahkreiger@gmail.com

I take suggestions, comments, and job opportunities! 

Best regards,
Noah Kreiger
